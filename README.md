**POeTiSA** is a long-term project aimed at developing syntax-based resources and tools for the Brazilian Portuguese language, striving to achieve world state-of-the-art results.

## 🌟 Project Goals

### 📚 Resources
- **Corpus Production**: Creating a large, comprehensive multi-genre corpus based on Universal Dependencies for part of speech and syntactically annotated texts.
  - **Genres**: News texts, User-generated content (tweets and online comments).

### 🛠️ Tools
- **Model Training**: Investigating recent neural and distributional-based methods for training robust parsing models for Portuguese.

### 🌐 Applications
- **Opinion Mining**: Utilizing syntactic knowledge for various applications:
  - Opinion summarization
  - Helpfulness prediction
  - Aspect identification
  - Deception detection
  - Emotion classification

## 📖 About the Project

This project is part of the **Natural Language Processing initiative (NLP²)** of the **Center for Artificial Intelligence (C4AI)** at the **University of São Paulo**. Sponsored by **IBM** and **FAPESP** (grant #2019/07665-4), the center is a part of the **FAPESP Engineering Research Centers Program** and is committed to state-of-the-art research in Artificial Intelligence, exploring both foundational issues and applied research.

The POeTiSA initiative is also supported by the **Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation**, with resources from **Law n. 8,248**, of October 23, 1991, under the **PPI-SOFTEX**, coordinated by **Softex** and published as Residency in **TIC 13, DOU 01245.010222/2022-44**. The project also benefits from an additional research grant for a related project coordinated by **Prof. Ivandré Paraboni** (FAPESP #2021/08213-0).

## 🔍 DANTE Project

The **DANTE** project is a specific initiative within POeTiSA, focusing on the creation of corpora on various topics. This involves compiling and annotating texts from multiple genres and sources to build a rich dataset that can be used for training and evaluating NLP models.
